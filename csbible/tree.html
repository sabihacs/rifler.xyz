<h1 id = "hi" > CS Growth</h1>
<p> This website exists to pass on tools I have utilized in my time playing Counter Strike to grow as a player. </p>
 
<p> While ingame mechanics and raw aim play a large part in becoming a better well rounded player, many tools exist today to aid in your growth mechanically and macro wise, utilizing these tools will be vital in becoming a better well rounded player and a better overall aimer.
    this guide will showcase ingame examples to get better aim and work on mechanics as well as external tools such as kovaaks and aimlabs to work on raw aim. </p>
<p> all this is applicable to cs2 to a degree </p>

           <h1 id = "hi" > about</h1>
           <p> This website exists to pass on tools I have utilized in my time playing Counter Strike to grow as a player. </p>
            
           <p> While ingame mechanics and raw aim play a large part in becoming a better well rounded player, many tools exist today to aid in your growth mechanically and macro wise, utilizing these tools will be vital in becoming a better well rounded player and a better overall aimer.
               this guide will showcase ingame examples to get better aim and work on mechanics as well as external tools such as kovaaks and aimlabs to work on raw aim. </p>
           <p> all this is applicable to cs2 to a degree </p>
    
    
      
    
    <h2>  about sabiha </h2>
    
<p> lifts heavy ass weights, smokes hella fucking zaza being global is dope! </p>
<p> played cs for the better part decade with a few breaks in the time period due to eye complications and upon returning to cs after surgeries I took up aim training and after aim training just went kinda beast mode and played a few seasons of competitive cs </p>
<p>never accomplished anything in the scene but I feel like im well rounded enough anyway and just want to pass on the tools I found and used to grow </p>
<p> I currently dont play counterstrike anymore as I dont enjoy the way cs2 feels and have moved on to other games / aim training and projects to fill the time that was once filled with csgo (the best game ever made fr....) </p>
<p>I have high hopes for cs2 getting the treatment I think it deserves and am faithully waiting for valve to make the game feel good to play again I just think it will take some time and love to get it back to where go was at</p>

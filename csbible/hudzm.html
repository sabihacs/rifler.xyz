    <h2>HudzM’s CS Theory </h2>
    
<P> This is legit just lifted from a google doc hudzm put out its worth reading if you have 0 experience with any team based related counter strike, it covers a lot of things that you just wont know and is a pretty good guide to just getting established. I did not write this one fellas im not gonna lie to you, I still think its worth a read even if you have experience more knowledge is more beneficial</P>
    <p>This document is an attempt to bring a system into that chaos, specifically around the macro decisions. It is untested, unverified and highly experimental, but I believe it’s reasonable to assume that this system would benefit a lot of teams (especially when not working with any system at the moment).
    </p>


    <h2>Cognitive Load
    </h2>
    <p>As discussed, it is critical to make the best decisions possible in every situation in order to win rounds and games. To make sure each player can make good decisions, we need to minimise the cognitive load that we put on them with each call.</p>
    <iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IkH0EGYqWO0" title="Cognitive Load Theory 3 - intrinsic, extraneous, germane." frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    
    
    <p>As we can see, it is extremely beneficial to minimise the intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load in order to free up space for the germane load, because this is where performance happens. When a player is confronted with a complex strategy in the beginning of the round or gets an unusual mid-round call, it blocks their head from focusing on the other important things: movement, fragging, angles, peeking, communicating.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s see how we can use this knowledge to our advantage.
    </p>


    <h3>Intrinsic Load</h3>
    <p>Split up strategies into smaller “compartment strategies” that have sets of protocols attached to them. Call the strategy one bit at a time so each player can focus on that part of the strategy with minimal intrinsic load.
    </p>


    <h3>Extraneous load
    </h3>
    <p>Give each compartment strategy a clear and distinguishable name. Discuss how the strategy looks like and dry-run it until there is no doubt in anyone’s minds on how it works.
    </p>
    <p>Check out this quote from the book called “The Power of Habit” (by Charles Duhigg) on Tony Dungy, a super-bowl winning NFL coach:
    </p>
    <p><em>In his job interviews, he would patiently explain his belief that the key to winning was changing players habits. He wanted to get players to stop making so many decisions during a game, he said. He wanted them to react automatically, habitually. If he could instill the right habits, his team would win. Period.
        “Champions don’t do extraordinary things,” Dungy would explain. “They do ordinary things, but they do them without thinking, too fast for the other team to react. They follow the habits they’ve learned.”
        </em></p>



    <h3>Incremental Improvements
    </h3>
    <p>Another key benefit of having smaller compartment strategies is that you can look at each individual part and make adjustments / troubleshoot issues specifically for that strategy or protocol</p>
    <p>When everyone knows how players are expected to react to a certain trigger (IGL call or a specific situation in game), it’s easier to call out mistakes and fix them. It also allows you to closely examine in what situations a strategy is working vs when it’s not working. This will be a key factor when we talk about advantages later on in this document.
    </p>




    <h3>Strategy Structure: Advantages
    </h3>
    <p>Let’s talk about how we could structure our compartment strategies into a system that makes sense. That’s where I like to talk about advantages, specifically answering these four questions:
    </p>
    <li>How do we gain an advantage?
    </li>
    <li>How do we extend our advantage?
    </li>
    <li>How do we convert the round based on the advantages?
    </li>
    <li>How do we recover after falling behind?
    </li>





    <h3>Types of Advantages
    </h3>
    <p>The major advantages you can gain during each round in CS are:
    </p>
    <li>Man advantage
    </li>
    <li>Utility advantage (specifically per bombsite)
    </li>
    <li>Map control
    </li>

    <p>There are also other types of advantages that you can’t gain but you can have by default at the beginning of a round.
    </p>
<li>Gun advantage
</li>
<li>Spawn advantage
</li>
<li>Skill advantage (this is huge as it makes trading more lucrative for your team)
</li>












    <h3>Gaining Advantages
    </h3>
    <p>It’s key to gain some sort of advantage early game in order to set your team up with the best chance to convert the round in your favour. Ideally with every early round play you target a primary advantage as well as a secondary advantage. A map control play can yield you a man advantage. A man advantage play gives you by definition the utility advantage overall (since you take out 1 players worth of utility), etc.
    </p>
    <h4>Gaining Man Advantage
    </h4>
    <p>This is often spawn based or based on information on how our opponents play:
    </p>
   <li>Do they like to push? Maybe we can just hold certain angles and gain a man advantage by letting them run into us.
</li>
   <li>Do they like to play a certain spot? Let’s throw a set piece of util to bait them out and kill them.
</li>
   <li>Do we have a great spawn? Let’s send the top spawn to get a first pick with some supportive utility.
</li>
<p>Other than that, you can also just brute force trades without using too much utility. You smoke off / molly off some common spots (e.g. left side mid on inferno) then double or triple peek the area where you want trades to happen with a simple pop flash. This is especially effective if you’re the better aimers. But beware as this can be extremely risky against an AWP or a good bait setup.
</p>


<h2>Gaining Map Control</h2>
<P>Things I categorize as map control plays are where you trade some of your utility for safe control of an area. Staying with inferno, that could mean your standard banana take with a molly at car, a molly at the corner and one behind sandbags, followed up with some flashes and potentially a smoke to extinguish enemy mollies. Against shit teams you’ll also gain man advantages here while good teams know when to evacuate the area.
</P>


<h2>Gaining Utility Advantage
</h2>

<p>You can also push the enemy to use utility from the get-go. You gain utility advantage with applying pressure, a.k.a faking. Often a pop flash and some pre-fires are enough to get a lot of teams to dump their utility. This is a great tactic for the lurkers / players that are not busy with gaining man or map advantage. Wouldn’t recommend making this a primary goal.
</p>


<h3>Extending Advantages
</h3>
<p>Once we’ve picked up an advantage, we can work on extending that advantage further in order to make sure we get into the best possible position before we close out the round. You’ll want to make controlled, safe plays where you can engage in at least equal trades with your opponents.
</p>
<li>Trade utility for counter-utility (fakes, second-pump executes, etc.)
</li>
<li>Give up map control and take it somewhere else
</li>
<li>Trade frags
</li>

<p>The reason why we want to focus on safe/equal trades is because advantages get bigger the less resources each team has. A 3v2 is easier to win than a 5v4. Re-gaining map control as CTs wastes time and utility and makes rotations a pain. Getting onto a bombsite where both parties only have 1 flash left highly favours the Terrorists, etc.
</p>
<p>It’s also crucial to understand that you don’t always need to extend advantages as this tends to slow down the round a lot. It’s good to switch up the pace and skip this step here and there in order to keep the enemy team guessing.
</p>

<h3>Converting Rounds
</h3>
<p>This is where your traditional strats sit: Executes, Splits, Fakes, Contact Plays. You’d want to think about the prerequisites in which each of your strategies are the strongest.
</p>
<li>An execute, for example, can easily be countered if your opponents have equal or better utility. Make sure you have the utility advantage.
</li>
<li>A split strategy will prove hard unless you have the map control required to allow you to split.
</li>
<li>A fake will only be effective if the opponents don’t have info on your rotations (you need map control).
</li>
<li>And finally a contact play will usually result in lots of frags being traded, so you’d be a lot better off having a man advantage.</li>

<h3>Recovering</h3>
<p>If you lose an advantage, you’ll want to make plays in order to remain a solid contender for the round. If you don’t act, the CTs will steamroll into the round win. I like to think of this part of the round as the fun zone: let your players completely focus on individual play (while still playing together, obviously) and roam freely to try making something happen. This is basically the hail mary of a round of CS. There are two scenarios:
</p>
<li>You regain the advantage due to a hero play: Great! Now quit the fun zone and get back into your system. You probably don’t have that much time left in the round so best just to group up and try to close out before the timer hits 0.
</li>
<li>You fail miserably: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ You tried!
</li>

<p> Alternatively you could group up the team fast to do an execute with the main goal to put the bomb down. If you’re lucky, the trades might go into your favour and you can grab the round win. If not, hey at least you got the bomb down.

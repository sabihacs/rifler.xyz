<h2>Weight Training</h2>
 
<p> I believe that a proper lifting regime will lead you to not only a healthier body but also a healthier mind, if you can please commit to a training regime that will build your body, the sheer value you will get out this in the time span of 6 to 12 months is insane, you can rebuild your physique while playing the game you love honestly even just making smaller changes to your lifestyle can have profound effects in game, its not a coincidence that Astralis's good performance in 2019 is directly tied to the players all having a coach a dietition and psychiatrists on call</p>
<p> Proper nutrition and exercise will play a vital role in your ability to learn and grow ingame and mechanically, sleep is where majority of the things you learn get condensed into muscle memory, so proper sleep is vital to growth just like in any skill, i personally like to aim train / do my aim routine before i sleep, and my warmup before actual pugs or scrims, </p>

<h2>If you are new to physical training dont be alarmed its not that hard bro</h2>
<p>Lifting is really enjoyable no lie, the sheer pride you feel from surpassing a weight you couldnt move the week prior is something unparrelled no lie.The channel linked below is a gold mine for lifting content as a natural lifter, if you want to add cardio feel free, the end goal is to just be more active to lead to a better level of health.   </p>
 <p> 
<p>just skim the channel and look for a physique that you like and embark on the routine, you can make alterations to it if you want or need its not that deep, any kind of activity is good.</p>

<p> its completely fine if you cant lift heavy weights now, i couldnt lift heavy at all (on god i couldnt bench the bar bro i had to get the bro to pick that shit up off me) but over the course of a year i got to a 200 pound bench and a 300 pound deadlift naturally, its all about consistency thats all there is to it, diet plays a large role in the muscle synthesis too but you dont really need to make massive changes to the way you eat unless your like boogie2988 or nikocado, if you just eat a little more than you should adding exercise to your life will still see you lose weight overtime. </p>   



<h2> Diet</h2>
<p>diet plays a large role in your fitness journey as well as proper nutrient intake, theres a pretty good chance you are nutrient starved and i really do think correcting that can lead to better performance in game and in your raw aim too. Look into cashing out on some multivitamins, magnesium, iron, zinc, vitamin a b c and fish oils, proper hydration goes a long way too in regards to general functionality and well being. </p>
<p> im not gonna get into crazy detail about diet just find out your BMR and adjust 500 > or < depending on the goal, if you want to gain weight > if you want to lose weight < and just remain in that surplus or deficit for how ever long it takes to hit the goal weight.</p>
<p> track your calories </p>
<li>1gram of protein - 4 calories </li>
<li>1gram of carbs - 4 calories </li>
<li>1gram of fats - 9 calories</li>
<li> dont drink alcohol its cringe</li>
<p> if you drink hella soda just switch to the zero sugar variants or ideally water, average american drinks like 600 calories a day that is wild when the daily average allowance is like 2.1k </p>
<p> below is a list to a pastebin filled with low calorie foods if you wish to make a change in your eating habits</p>
<p> <a href ="https://pastebin.com/raw/93cLG9jj"> list of low-calorie foods and drinks

<p>all in all i think proper diet and exercise will lead you to being a better player. you wont have a healthy mind if you dont have a healthy body and vice versa.</p>

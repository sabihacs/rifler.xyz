<h2> Aim </h2>

<p>Just click them bro its not that hard. at the end of the day if you can click on the other people on the server your are in a better position to win the game 
    if you want to go the route of aim demon and just out aim everyone that wants to challenge you good news that is very attainable, many tools exist now to train individual parts of your aim 
    there are many communities built around benchmarking raw aim and improving aspects of your aim, such as Voltaic, Revosect, Aimerz and so on. </p>
<P> If you do not wish to use external tools such as aim trainers and benchmarks you can get rather goated just via playing CS over time 
with a proper routine layed out you can see growth over a large period of time, many professionals abide by the aimbotz > deathmatch > pug methodology and just running that overtime will lead to growth. 

  
<h2> Crosshair Placement</h2>
<p>Proper crosshair placement will just net you frags, unironically, its that easy.</p>
<p>Proper crosshair placement is a god send, learning hwo to play positions and crosshair placements will just get you freelo, use the yprac maps for each map in your pool that you play and learn the common angles, drilling them for a week or two will lead you to a higher win rate taking fights on angles that you were unsure of, like proper banana pathing on inferno or proper angle clearing onto the a site on inferno, learning the proper pathing will make you more confident and will make the rounds more formulaic without randomness on your part.</p>
<p> <a href ="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=740795413" Kovaaks playlists >yprac collection of maps </a></p>
<p> Think of it as making protocols for yourself when you play a certain position, things you do almost every single round, these will eliminate uncertainty in your round to round gameplay,</p>
<p> Learning how to properly clear angles and take fights is all tied to crosshair placement.</p>

<h2>Dueling</h2>
<p>samRi makes a lot of videos that are genuinely good that will get you goated at cs, he talks about gamesense in this vid and aim as well as the psychology of certain players.</p>

<h2>Movement</h2>
<p> look at how bro moves around mirage so effortlessly, you can get this with a bit of practice and patience, learn how to strafe properly and jump properly and this is you brodie.this movement is actually practical on mirage too in a competitive setting being able to consistantly make the catwalk jump from window or the vent jump from window is so valuable.   
<p> just grind kz and climb to get better movement, play the movement maps on the workshop for specific jumps, bare minimun learn the catwalk jump and the silent drops on the maps you play as they will just net you more round wins </p>

<h2>Kovaaks</h2>
<p>I am an avid kovaaks enjoyer and the time i have spent in the tool has translated incredibly well to every game i've moved on to play</p>
<p>Overtime your mouse feel will get better and you'll make better movements through repitition over time, aim training is good for working on your flaws and weaknesses to build them into strenghts over time. </p>
<p> Again these are all tied to consistancy, repetition is key for growth in any skill, for the low low price of 15 AUD you cant really go wrong with this tool. treat it like the gym by playing consistantly and watch the gains come on god.</p>
<p> I personally just play the benchmarks and a selection of playlists that focus on specific aiming types for tac fps games, focusing on horizontal adjustments, speed, flicks and minor tracking as well as playing aim maps in cs and deathmatches to remain mechanically flush,  </p>
<p>I turn off the viewmodels and shit for kovaaks, no need for them to be present just make a nice crosshair similar to your cs crosshair, fov 103 overwatch and just play, your sensitivity is really just your own personal preference there is no GOD sens or anything its all just about you being able to aim comfortably, personally I like to use 41.56
cm / 360 for counter strike.</p>
<p> just find something that is comfortable ultimately, a blend of arm and wrist aiming is kinda key for finding your sens.</p>


 





<h2>Aspects of aim</h2>

<ul>  
 <li>clicking - clicking on static and dynamic targets </li>
 <li>tracking - smooth tracking and evasive tracking are the primary ones you will play</li>
 <li>switching - switching between targets </li>
</ul>

<p>each of these have prominence in counter strike, static being peaking into players holding an angle, dynamic being players swinging you, tracking also applies to targets swinging you, switching is just multiple enemies on screen that you switch too its pretty self explanatory gang.... </p>
<p> focus on each of these equally as you are only as strong as your weakest link</p>
<p>below are tools and playlists for training specific weaknesses</p>


<h2>Kovaaks Aim converting to CS  Aim</h2>
<p>This video from samRi will explain it better than i ever will</p>

<h2>Consistency</h2>
</P>
<P>At the end of the day its all routine, if you dont have a solid routine in place you will never really be consistant. 
    if you want to adopt a routine one i've seen float around t1 and t2 players is 
<ul> 
    <li>aimbotz warmup (just get warm and loose) </li>
    <li>deathmatch / hs only deathmatch 250 kills to 500 kills focusing on methods such as spraying, tapping , flicks etc </li>
    <li>kovaaks playlist or aimlabs playlist focusing on weakness or general tac shooter playlist</li>
</ul>
</P>


<p> Committing to the routine for a long period of time will net results. after 30 days you are bound to be better than where you were when you started.</p>
<p>Mechanics will only carry you so far in this game to a point, once you get into higher skilled matches the skill is really in knowledge and team play, there is no point in being the sharpest person on the server if one flash is all it takes to take you out the round, you have to learn when and how to play anti and play off of others unironically.</p>
